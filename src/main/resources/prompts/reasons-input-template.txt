My software is licensed under {myLicense}. This may conflict with another license, {otherLicense}. If these licenses conflict, please give me a concise, one-sentence description of why these two licenses may conflict with each other, including any conditions upon that conflict. Otherwise, say "NO CONFLICT" in capital letters and nothing else. If you do not know the answer, say "UNSURE" in capital letters and nothing else.
